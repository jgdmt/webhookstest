**Roles of tutors:** *Helpers*

**Retribution:** *Coalition Points, Achievements*

Sprints will be organized in the first week of each month. We'll need tutors to act as 'Helper'. Every 2 days, a meeting will be organized with the sprinters to check their progress and guide them.

That's why we're looking for tutors who have a good grasp of the project they want to 'manage'.
