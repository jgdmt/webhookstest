## Bocal and Tutors exams
Since November 2023, and some difficulty in guaranteeing the organisation of exams due to a lack of tutors, the Bocal has instituted new rules for exams.

### Bocal exams
Every month, "Bocal exams" are organized. They happen on Tuesdays, at 10 am. They are normal exams but guaranteed by the Bocal: if not enough tutors can be present to watch the exam, the Bocal team will take over and make sure the exam will be happening.

Only Bocal exams will be guaranteed.

### Tutor exams
On top of the "Bocal exams", tutors can organize exams at their time and hour convenience.

NB: At the moment, 1 exam is guaranteed the first Thursday (week) of the month, and 1 optional the last Thursday (week) of the month, so 2 max per month.

## Exam attendance
When you are subscribed to an exam, either as a Student or a Tutor, you **have to be present**.

As a tutor, you should notify any supervising tutor if you can't come.

If you still don4t respect this rule, the reward will be a TIG.

(*2h* for tutors and *2h * number of absents* for students)

## How to ask for a Tutor exam
You can still ask for an exam to be organized by reaching out to one of the supervising tutors.

Here are the prerequisites:
- Minimum 15 students
- 3~ tutors **PER** period **PER** cluster
- No event already planned

The rules are the same for the tutors exam.

**Supervising tutors can decide to cancel an exam if not enough tutors are available.**
