# Piscines

## Tutoring during the Piscine

Tutoring during the Piscine is another thing.

You don't have the "roles" as before and sometimes it can be quite difficult to know what to do in some cases.

Tutors during Piscine, when they want, can:
- Help pisciners for **starting the piscine** and only for that
- Notify the bocal when you think something is wrong

Yes, the list is short, but it is normal, as a tutor, we are not supposed to interfere too much in the piscine.

NB: Pisciners can't use the BeCentral, nor the ping pong table.

## Non-exhaustive list of things a tutor cannot do during the Piscine

- Give coding advce to pisciners (website, pure code, or other form of help that can speed up significantly their progression)
- Suggest/Encourage "wrong" use of programming tools (ChatGPT, Github, and so on)
- Going to the "Piscine cluster" for no REAL reason (saying hello to your friend every 30 min is not)
- **Spreading false rumors**
- Trolling pisciners in any manner *(should be defined)*

## Tutors during the Piscine Exam

The rules and good behavior change for the Piscine exam and especially for the 1st one.

Basically, it's the same as classic Exam with some additions but a little reminder is always a good idea :) :
- 40 min before the exam, we regroup all tutors for a little recap, and AMA
- We welcome the exam pisciners 30min before the start, they put their bag on the side with their phone OFF (they can only enter if verified by a **SUPERVISING** TUTOR) and they can't choose their place
- In the clusters, **NO TALK** is allowed. Tutors can make a gentle reminder of this rule; after it, any talking exam participant needs to be asked to leave the room
- **No food** allowed (except for the **LAST EXAM**)
- For any question, they need to STAND UP
- For the 1st exam and 2nd exam, tutors can help on any login problem (remember: login not in caps lock), git problem, or anything not related to pure coding. After that, only login problems
- When someone has finished their exam, they need to leeeeeeeave
- PLEASE OPEN THE WINDOWS

As for **HOW** you are supposed to behave during the exam:
- Please do not stay behind someone. Looking at their code for no reason can be really frustrating or stressful
- Keep a reasonable amount of tutors in the clusters (basically at least 3 tutors on a full cluster + toilet)
- While you can listen to music, always have one ear free
- Of course, you **can't help** with anything related to code, **right**?
- If you think something is wrong, or you have any doubt, don't hesitate to contact a Supervising Tutor
